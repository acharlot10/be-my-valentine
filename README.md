## Tech Stack

- **React** - UI library
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **CSS3** - Styling and animations

## How It Works

1. The homepage displays a beautiful question "Will You Be My Valentine?" with animated floating hearts
2. Two buttons are presented: "Yes! 💖" and "No 😢"
3. Clicking "Yes" shows a happy celebration with a loving GIF
4. Clicking "No" shows a sad GIF with a "try again" message
5. Each time "No" is clicked, a different persuasive message appears to encourage trying again!

## Try Again Messages

The app includes 10 different messages that cycle when "No" is clicked:
- "Are you sure? 🥺"
- "Please reconsider... 💔"
- "Think about all the good times! 💕"
- "I'll be sad without you... 😢"
- "Maybe you need more time? ⏰"
- "I promise to make you happy! 🌟"
- "Don't break my heart! 💘"
- "Pretty please? 🙏"
- "I'll be the best valentine ever! 🎁"
- "One more chance? 🌹"
